      "About": "Just named Wetherspoons, this site was named by Tim Martin, chairman of JDW, after his primary school teacher in New Zealand! The pub overlooks the station concourse on both sides and has recently been refurbished in a bright cafÃ© bar design. The interior features blue and cream tiling, two curved bars with marble style tops and the welcome addition of banquettes along the opposite side. The large hexagonal lampshades and snugs introduce design characteristics reminiscent of the 1920s and 1930s. The twelve handpumps on two bar counters dispense regular beers and changing guest ales from smaller brewers such as Thornbridge and often local brewers like Portobello; the alcohol licence allows retail sale from 8am. Screens show times of train departures. Note that British Transport police sometimes close the bar when football fans are due through the station.",

      "About": "Formerly the Lord Burleigh and originally an 1852 beer house. In spite of the amusing derivation of Brass Monkey given in the pub printed menus, the association with cannon balls is considered very unlikely and the name probably derives from the tourist-souvenir sets of alloy brass monkeys made in China and Japan in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This welcoming modern single room cafe-style pub narrows back to a small, curved bar and a tiny raised WiFi zone strictly for customers spending at least Â£5. A simple menu of burgers, pies, fish and chips etc is on offer. Handy for Victoria Station, with comfortable seating and without the distraction of TV sport, it attracts a good mixed clientele.",

Some wood panelling, quite a low ceiling and subdued lighting create a warm atmosphere. One TV is usually switched off, the other silent. Friendly and attentive staff look after a mixed clientele including families. This busy Wetherspoon#039;s has 12 hand pumps and supports LocAle, offering Twickenham Fine Ales among its selection. Prints on the walls give information on local history. The pub dates from October 1999 and was previously a Woolworth.Note that the licence allows alcohol sale from 9am.",
